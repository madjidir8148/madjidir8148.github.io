    <p>The last veicle on this list goes to the Opresser. This is also a highly lethal vehicle to use in online. The Opresser is uniqe for its expandable wings and its rocket on the back.</p>

    <p>The best plane you can buy is the Pyro, because it is the fastest plane in the game. The Pyro is very fast making it eacy to dodge missials comming its way. It also looks nice and handles well.</p>
